| IC | Function| Usages in Project | Suggested Qty | Datasheet|
| -- | ------- | ----------------- | ------------- | -------- |
| 7400 | NAND Gate | NAND is a Universal logic gate; meaning every other gate can be made by combining a number of NANDs. | More than 5 | [Datasheet](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn7400.pdf) |
| 7402 | NOR Gate | NOR is another Universal logic gate | More than 5 | [Datasheet](http://web.mit.edu/6.131/www/document/7402.pdf) |
| 555 | Timer | Used in making oscialltors or debouncers. Responsible for clock pulses, etc. |More than 5 | [Datasheet](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm555.pdf)|
| LM7805 | Voltage Regulator| Outputs a fixed **five volts** voltage. When you don't use a development board like Arduino or when you don't have a five volt power supply, you can use this IC to regulate the voltage. | 2 or 3 | [Datasheet](https://www.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Components/LM7805.pdf) |
| LM317 | Adjustable Voltage Regulator | By using 2 resistors you can get a voltage output anywhere from 1.25 to 37 volts. You can even use it in a setup to act as a constant-current supply.| 4 | [Datasheet](www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm317.pdf) |
| 74HC4051 | Analog Multiplexer/Demultiplexer | Can be used to extend pins of a microcontroller or driving a seven segment, in general a mulitplexer/demultiplexer isused everywhere we need to extend or select. | 5 | [Datasheet](http://assets.nexperia.com/documents/data-sheet/74HC_HCT4051.pdf) |
| 74HC595 | Serial-In , Parallel Out shift register | Can be used for extending pins, driving a seven segment, programming EEPROM's, etc. Shift Registersare usually used to extend| 10 | [Datasheet](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/sn74hc595.pdf) |
| LM358 | Low-Power, Dual-Operational Amplifiers| Op-Amps have an extensive list of applications, from simple voltage-gain to AM radios and microphone pre-amps. These ICs are very handyand have a lot of use cases. | 5 | [Datasheet](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/lm158-n.pdf) |
| TIP122 | Darlington Bipolar Power Transistor | Though TIP122 technically isn't an IC it's a must-have part for anyone who whishes to combine logic-level devices withhigh-current, high-voltage loads.| 10 | [Datasheet](http://www.onsemi.com/PowerSolutions/product.do?id=TIP122) |
